# Week 5: Linked List / Stack / Queue Library

## Project Overview
Implement classic data structures (linked list, stack, and queue) from scratch to master pointer manipulation and memory management.

## Learning Objectives
- Manual memory management with pointers
- Node-based data structure design
- LIFO (stack) and FIFO (queue) operations
- Iterator implementation
- Template programming for generic types

## Features to Implement
- [ ] Singly linked list with insert, delete, search
- [ ] Doubly linked list support
- [ ] Stack implementation (array and linked list based)
- [ ] Queue implementation (array and linked list based)
- [ ] Push, pop, peek operations
- [ ] Iterator support for traversal
- [ ] Copy constructor and assignment operator
- [ ] Move semantics
- [ ] Size and empty checks

## Data Structures to Include
- **Singly Linked List**: One-way traversal
- **Doubly Linked List**: Bidirectional traversal
- **Stack**: LIFO (Last In, First Out)
- **Queue**: FIFO (First In, First Out)
- **Circular Queue**: Efficient fixed-size queue

## Key Concepts
- Pointer manipulation and ownership
- Memory leak prevention
- Node insertion and deletion
- Sentinel nodes and dummy heads
- Template specialization

## Extensions
- Implement a deque (double-ended queue)
- Add priority queue implementation
- Create circular/ring buffer
- Add thread-safe versions with locks
- Implement intrusive list for zero allocation
